This is just a sample. You can play around with your own text right here.

Markdown
----------

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
 - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!

Name | Lunch order | Spicy      | Owes
------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------:
Joan  | saag paneer | medium | $11
Sally  | vindaloo        | mild       | $14
Erin   | lamb madras | HOT      | $5

There are **multiple syntax highlighting themes** to choose from. Here's one of them:

```javascript
// All the code you will ever need
var hw = "Hello World!"
alert(hw);
```

My math is so rusty that I barely remember the _quadratic equation_:
$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
